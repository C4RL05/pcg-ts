# pcg-ts — plan

What is still ahead, and what was deliberately decided against.

Everything in this file is live. **Backlog** entries are wanted and
unscheduled, waiting on a real consumer to specify the mechanism.
**Stretch** entries record decisions NOT to build, with the measurements
that killed them — that is the expensive part to re-derive, so it is kept
even though nothing will act on it.

## Where the build log went

This file used to carry the phase-by-phase build plan: v0.1 through v0.12
plus phases 44-46, 47 of 48 phases, every one of them shipped. That was
~1,900 lines describing finished work, and the git history describes the
same work more accurately — each phase landed as its own commit, so
`git log` is the record, and unlike a checked-in tracker it cannot drift
from what actually merged.

The old "core type sketch" went with it. It was aligned to the v0.2 API
and said so in its own heading; `dist/*.d.ts`, `docs/nodes.json` and
`llms.txt` are generated from the code and are current by construction.

To read the plan as it stood at any release, check out its tag (`v0.1.0`
through `v0.14.0`), or follow this file back with
`git log --oneline -- PLAN.md`.

## Backlog — earned, waiting for a caller

Distinct from "Stretch" below, and the distinction is the point: Stretch
records things DECIDED AGAINST, with the measurements that killed them.
These are things we want, deferred only because nothing is pulling yet.
Every re-survey this cycle changed its own phase once a real consumer
existed, so the discipline is to let the consumer specify the mechanism
rather than guess at it. Each entry carries the analysis, because
re-deriving it is the expensive part.

**Primitive identity, so primitive-domain randomness stops being
index-keyed.** Point-domain randomness is keyed on position bits and a
seed attribute (`src/data/identity.ts`), so it survives a renumbering.
Primitive-domain randomness has no such identity and falls back to the
element index — which means it re-rolls whenever anything upstream changes
the ORDER primitives come out in, even when the set is unchanged.
- **Measured 2026-08-14 on `examples-rig.json`**, and this is what makes
  it worth an entry rather than a note. Moving the spine by 1.9e-6 world
  units — an f32 rounding, nothing more — left `connectPoints` emitting
  the same 456 edges with sorted lengths agreeing to 2.4e-7, but 156 of
  the 456 slots held a different edge. `chordPick` is a `randomField` on
  the primitive domain, so 63 chords passing its threshold became 54, and
  198 tube instances appeared out of a last-bit change. A control
  confirms the mechanism is not the field-param work: nudging the
  unwrapped original's baked noise frequency by a relative 1e-8 does the
  same thing.
- So a graph that is perfectly deterministic is not STABLE: any numerical
  improvement anywhere upstream — a reassociated sum, a faster spatial
  grid, the f32-vs-f64 difference between two spellings of the same knob
  — silently reshuffles every downstream primitive-keyed random. That is
  exactly the class of change `tests/corpus.test.ts` says it wants to
  survive.
- The fix is the phase-42 answer at a new domain: derive a primitive's
  identity from its ENDPOINTS' identities (order-independently, so an
  edge and its reverse agree), the way a point's comes from its position
  bits. Wants a caller before it is designed — the honest trigger is the
  first time someone is bitten by a corpus diff they cannot explain, or
  the first graph that needs a stable per-edge random across an edit.

**Strings readable as fields.** A field cannot read a string attribute,
so a `species` or `biome` string cannot drive a density field. Workaround
today: `setAttribute` in string mode already takes a NUMERIC selector to
index its `values` list, so an author has that number in hand and can
write it to an int attribute with one extra node.
- **The obvious design is a determinism bug, and this is the part worth
  keeping.** A field fn returning the string's TABLE INDEX would expose
  an insertion-ordered artifact: the same logical value can intern at
  different indices in different geometries, and under partitioned
  cooking, in different cells. It is the identity-versus-index lesson of
  phase 42 wearing a new costume, and it would pass every test we have
  until two cells disagreed.
- The safe form is a PREDICATE — `attributeIs(name, "pine")` → 0/1 —
  which never exposes the index. It also compiles to the GPU cleanly:
  the literal resolves against the geometry's string table HOST-SIDE at
  kernel build time, so the kernel compares a u32 column to a constant
  and the hazard disappears because the index never leaves the host.
- Cost: the fixed five-site grammar change `ne` and `fraction` both paid.

**A field input that yields the node seed.** A serialized noise carries
its seed as a LITERAL inside its field spec, so changing a graph's seed
re-rolls everything keyed on a node seed — `randomField`, the scatters,
the jitters, the probabilistic filters — and moves no noise at all. All
20 corpus graphs that use a noise are in this position; it is a property
of the format, not a defect in any one of them.
- **It surfaced when the rig was frozen**, which is the consumer. Its
  four `*Variant` params existed precisely to re-roll one shape at a
  time, and they worked by folding into the noise seed host-side. Frozen,
  they are gone: the seed they computed is a number in a spec.
- **The obvious workaround is worse than the gap.** A panel knob
  addresses `"<nodeId>.<param>"` and cannot reach INTO a field spec, so
  the only way to make a frozen noise movable today is to write an offset
  to an attribute and add it to the noise's sample `position` — which
  works (the rig's cables decorrelate their wobble exactly this way) but
  costs a node per noise, spreads a convention no other graph follows,
  and still leaves the seed box doing nothing to it.
- The mechanism that fits is a grammar input — `{ "fn": "nodeSeed" }` —
  resolving to `ctx.seed`, which is already what `randomField` reads. It
  is the fixed five-site grammar change `ne` and `fraction` both paid,
  plus a WGSL lowering that has a constant to fold rather than a value to
  compute. Every frozen graph becomes seed-re-rollable at once, which is
  the difference between this and the per-graph workaround.
- Until then a graph is a fixed recipe whose seed moves its scatters and
  not its shapes. That is worth stating in prose somewhere an author
  reads before they wonder why the seed box did half of what they
  expected.

**A per-item cache for `forEach`.** The loop shipped; this is the one
piece of it deliberately left out, and the measurement is the expensive
part to re-derive. A `forEach` cooks its body once per element and
memoizes nothing between iterations, so an edit anywhere upstream
recooks all K.
- **Caching per item does not pay against its own motivating producer.**
  `partitionByAttribute` calls `makeGeometryItem` per group on every
  execute, and that mints a fresh `rev` — so when anything upstream
  moves, all K groups arrive with new revs even where K-1 are
  byte-identical, and a rev-keyed cache misses on all of them. When
  nothing moves, the `forEach` node's own memo key is unchanged and the
  whole node is a hit, so the per-item cache is never consulted. Its win
  case is the narrow band where exactly one item's rev moved: a
  `dataInput` binding from the World, not the partition producer the
  feature exists for.
- **Keying it on content alone would be unsound**, which is the trap
  worth recording: a changed "pine" group would serve the old "pine"
  bytes. `(contentKey, rev)` is sound and never hits, per above.
- So the prerequisite is a rev-stable `partitionByAttribute` — one that
  hands an unchanged group back its previous item rather than minting a
  new one. That is a separate, well-scoped change, and it is what a
  consumer should ask for first.
- Two hazards for whoever builds it. A cached item carrying
  `deviceBatches` hands out a handle its consumer already disposed —
  the executor marks those entries `volatile` for exactly this reason,
  so any cache must refuse them. And the no-node-mutates-its-input rule
  the aliasing rests on is a convention (`cloneGeometry` at 46 sites),
  not an enforced invariant: a third-party node that mutates its input
  corrupts a shared cache where today it corrupts only its own memo.

**A topology-preserving union.** `mergePoints` destroys topology, so two
polyline geometries cannot be combined — which blocks mixing authored
and procedural networks (a hand-placed trail plus a generated one). Was
ranked #3 in the stage-5 design's missing list.

**Documentation that quotes measured output has no assertion behind
it.** Phase 44's docs pass found the manual's Part II transcripts had
silently become fiction — 1008 points where the library now produces
1038, a stale determinism fingerprint, an error listing 25 registered
types against a registry of 38 — because phases 42-44 moved per-point
randomness onto identity and every number shifted. The countable half is
now policed by `COUNT_CLAIMS` in `src/docs/site.ts` (19 claims). The
transcripts are not. Fixing it means either generating them or asserting
them, and both are real work.

**`Graph.setParam` validates nothing.** `paramValueError`
(`src/graph/params.ts`) refuses a non-finite `f32`/`i32`/`u32` and any
non-finite component of a `vec3`/`vec4`, and it is called from exactly
three places: deserialization (`src/nodes/serialize.ts`), exposed-param
resolution (`src/graph/subgraph.ts`) and World/worker patches
(`src/runtime/patches.ts`). `Graph.setParam` calls `_setParamQuiet` and
bumps the version with no schema check at all, so the plain-param
finiteness refusal is a SERIALIZATION-boundary check rather than a
cook-time one and a TypeScript author can set a plain NaN and cook it.
- Surfaced by the non-finite guard, which deliberately does NOT close it:
  that guard scans FIELD-resolved columns, and a plain value's finiteness
  is decidable from the 1-4 raw numbers it is made of. A full column scan
  standing in for a 4-number check would cost about 6x more on the rig
  for no coverage a schema check would not give.
- Not a blind close, either. `filterByBounds.boundsMin`/`boundsMax`
  document ±Infinity as the intended spelling for an unbounded axis, and
  `requireBounds3`'s own error tells the author to write
  `[ctx.min[0], -Infinity, ctx.min[1]]`. JSON has no `Infinity` literal,
  so that value can ONLY arrive through the one door that does not check:
  the gap and the feature are the same gap. Closing it needs a way for
  `ParamSchema` to say "infinite is meaningful here" (or those two params
  named as exceptions), which is the design work this entry is waiting
  for a caller to justify.

## Stretch — surveyed and NOT scheduled

- **Rescaling the shared noise convention so an amplitude knob reaches
  its stated bound.** Measured 2026-08-09 across all 34 primitives.
  **Recommendation: do not schedule.** Every noise-amplitude param
  under-delivers, because the catalog's shared `amp × remap(normalized
  fBm)` term normalizes against fBm's THEORETICAL range while its
  realized range is far narrower: `transform/displace-by-noise` reaches
  0.42 of its promised `±amount`, and the threshold knobs on
  `filter/mask-by-noise` and `fill/volume-by-noise` do all their travel
  inside 0.32–0.68 rather than 0–1. The obvious fix is a two-line
  constant rescale in `tunableFbm`, and it is wrong: utilization is NOT
  a constant — 0.42 on a wide 2D cloud, 0.50 in 3D, 0.25 on a patch
  spanning about one period — so a constant factor converts systematic
  UNDER-delivery into position-dependent error, overshooting to 1.17×
  on wide high-frequency clouds. An `amount` that sometimes EXCEEDS its
  stated bound is worse than one that reliably undershoots it. A
  per-cook fit to the realized range would be exact and breaks the
  determinism invariant outright: under partitioned cooking each
  partition would fit its own range, so the same point would move
  differently depending on how the work was split. What shipped instead
  is the honest alternative — every one of these params now documents
  its measured law and band, with tests pinning them. If a
  true-amplitude knob is ever wanted, add it opt-in beside the existing
  one; do not move what already ships.

- **Device-produced asset keys** (make `setAttribute` resident in
  string `values` mode). Surveyed 2026-08-07; **recommendation: do not
  schedule.** Recorded here so it is not picked up later on the
  premises it was written with, all three of which the survey broke:
  - *"It would extend the forest's run to its full chain."* It would
    not. Every field in `examples/02-forest` is code-authored and
    carries no `FieldSpec`, and fusability requires all field params to
    be spec'd — so widening the resident predicate moves the forest
    from 1 fused member to 1. The benefit is zero, not small.
  - *"It would finally require the stable counting sort."* It would
    not. WebGPU has no device-side allocation, and the host must know
    each batch's `assetId` (a string), its `count`, and how many
    batches there are before it can allocate. A readback is therefore
    unavoidable in every candidate design, and all of them pay the same
    mid-run pass split. The only question is how many bytes ride an
    already-paid round trip — reading back the key column is `n * 4`
    against a constant `2K`, i.e. microseconds of bandwidth against a
    sub-millisecond latency. Buying that with the repo's first atomics,
    first workgroup-shared memory and first cross-workgroup scan — and
    a determinism proof argued rather than inherited from
    `groupPointsByAsset` — is a bad trade.
  - *"The kernel writes `lut[clamp(floor(selector), 0, last)]`."* Not
    portable: the CPU semantics are `floor`, then `!(idx > 0) -> 0`,
    which is deliberately NaN-safe (NaN selects index 0). WGSL `clamp`
    carries no such guarantee, so that body would violate the
    determinism invariant.

  If it is ever revisited, the design to build is the cheap one: read
  back the key column and reuse the shipped `groupPointsByAsset`.

- ~~**The better opener:** give code-authored field combinators their
  own `FieldSpec`s.~~ Surveyed and **scheduled as v0.9, phases 32-34**
  above. The survey confirmed it is cheap but reframed the reason: the
  GPU gain is small (`02-forest` 1 member → 3), while the real cost of
  today's behaviour is that a graph holding a combinator field cannot
  be serialized at all.

- **A `resident` descriptor for `filterByAttribute`** (a count-changing
  resident member). Surveyed 2026-08-08; **recommendation: do not
  schedule.** Feasible, and cheaper than this entry assumed — the
  data-dependent count is *not* the blocker v0.9's survey found for
  device-produced keys, because the input count bounds every
  allocation, no field's value depends on the element count, and the
  surviving count rides the run's existing readback as four extra
  bytes. Two findings settle it anyway:
  - **It does not compose with the zero-round-trip path.** At a spawner
    terminal the surviving count sizes a retained buffer and there is
    no readback for it to ride (`needsGeometry === false`). So a run
    may never contain both a count-changing member and an instances
    terminal — the feature is architecturally exclusive with what
    phases 26-30 built, which is the line this project has invested
    most in.
  - **The forest's entire saving is free today.** Moving
    `setAttribute("scale")` ahead of the two filters in
    `examples/02-forest` buys the same one readback for zero library
    work (different random scales, equally valid). Any estimate of this
    feature must be net of that, and net of it the benefit is close to
    nothing.

  It would also retire the safety argument at `run.ts:11-18` — "every
  kernel touches only element `i`" is why attribute buffers are bound
  in place as `read_write`, and a prefix scan breaks that. If it is
  ever revisited, build the cheap shape: host-normalized
  `(comparison, f32 threshold)`, a global ping-pong scan with **no
  atomics** (an atomic bump would make survivor order nondeterministic),
  a device-side count word, and materialization reusing the shipped
  `gatherPoints` so the ordering spec keeps one implementation — the
  shape v0.8 and v0.9 both converged on. And gate it on a measurement:
  the scan must beat the round trip it eliminates at the counts the
  examples actually use.

  Full survey: `notes/research/v10-resident-filter-survey.md` in the
  private repo, including a phase breakdown if it is scheduled anyway.

- ~~**Free and unscheduled:** reorder `examples/02-forest` so
  `setAttribute("scale")` precedes the two filters.~~ **Done**
  2026-08-08 (`0ed9290`): 2 runs / 4 members, one readback fewer, no
  library change. It captured the entire benefit the resident-filter
  descriptor above was going to be built for.

- **A `maxDegree` bounded within a radius.** Halo-exact and unbuilt. The
  distinction that makes it safe: an unbounded k-nearest is the trap, a
  bounded RANK is not — within a radius the witness for any pair lies
  inside that pair's own neighbourhood, so a partition cannot change the
  answer. Chaining maximal degree-2 runs into longer polylines is the
  part that stays out of reach: it is NOT partition-invariant at the
  primitive domain, because the edge set and the geometry agree across a
  split while the grouping does not. (`findPath` remains cut for the
  related reason that no finite halo suffices for a global shortest
  path.)

- **Per-cause serialization refusal messages.** `fieldToJson` refuses
  with one message that *enumerates* all three causes — a `makeField`
  closure, anything composed over one, and a tree past
  `MAX_SPEC_DEPTH` — rather than naming the one that actually applies.
  `serializeGraph` prefixes it with `node "<id>" param "<key>"`, so the
  location is always exact; only the cause is ambiguous. CLAUDE.md
  treats error messages as part of the agent API, and "it is one of
  these three" is weaker than this library's standard elsewhere.
  Not fixable in the message alone: nothing records *why* a spec is
  absent, because `undefined` propagates up the derivation without a
  reason. Needs a reason carried alongside the withheld spec (the depth
  `WeakMap` in `src/fields/spec.ts` is the obvious place), then the
  three call sites in `fieldToJson` discriminate on it. Small, and
  worth doing the next time `src/fields/spec.ts` is open for another
  purpose.

- **Give `04-infinite-world` a GPU evaluator.** It has `09-gpu-world`'s
  shape authored with combinators, so it became the natural showcase
  once v0.9 landed — but it is example work, not library work.

Full survey: `notes/research/v09-device-keys-survey.md` in the private
repo.

## Execution notes (unattended)
- Phases run in order; no phase starts until the previous phase's exit
  criteria pass.
- Per CLAUDE.md: bulk implementation of a phase may be delegated to a
  subagent owning that phase's files; nontrivial phases get an independent
  verification agent before being marked complete.
- After every phase (and significant mid-phase milestone): run full tests,
  commit `phase(N): ...`. The commit history IS the progress record.
- Blockers that need a user decision are raised with the user rather than
  stalling silently — pick the most reasonable default, note it in the
  commit message, and continue.
